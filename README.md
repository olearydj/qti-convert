# qti-convert
Converts QTI (LMS quiz format) to other formats

This Python code is provided as-is and enhancements are welcome. The goal is to provide a simple script for converting QTI XML files into other formats, like PDF and Word. Even if these quizes are made digital-first, some teachers want to print them out to paper, for which there is no straightforward way today as I know about.

Uses pipenv for package dependencies.
